<h1>Welcome to BearHacks</h1>
<h5>This following guide will teach you how to make your first website</h5>
<br>

A (static) website consists of 3 parts:
<ul>
	<a href='#html'><li>HTML</li></a>
	<a href='#css'><li>CSS</li></a>
	<a href='#js'><li>JS</li></a>
</ul>

<div id='html'>
	The HTML is the file that is interpreted by the browser. This means the browser (IE, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Opera) will read this file and figure out how to display the text. Think of this as the skeleton of your website. This contains all the words and images you want to display. <br>
	If you're looking at the file in its raw format now (not in the browser), you might be wondering why it's indented. Does indenting even mean anything? Nope! not at all. It's just to make it easier to read. If you wanted to, you could have this all in 1 line, and the browser will still be able to generate the same website from your instructions. But it'd be a pain to edit later on! 
</div>

<div id='css'>
	The CSS is the file that will add fonts and styling to your html. Try <a href='withoutcss.html'>loading the file without CSS</a>, and you'll see what a giant difference it makes to the aesthetics of your site! 
</div>

<div id='js'>
	JavaScript is designed to make yoru site do more fancy things, like animations. For example, you can make the text <a onclick="turnBlue()">blue</a>, change the font weight, or make this turtle fly across your screen. A lot of times, you don't need JS to make your website spiffy if yoru CSS is enough. But there is some overlapping functions between JS and CSS, and depending on the situation, you might find it easier to use one or the other.
